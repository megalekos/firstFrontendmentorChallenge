## My process
I first set up all tags as suggested in the instructions. I started with desktop, for no reason. Then, looking at how the site is set up, I thought that flexbox would solve most things, and started dividing stuff into divs. After some styling I ran into problems with the divs, and after solving them I added all CSS. Lastly I added the respnsiveness/mobile version.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I had forgotten how to use GitHub, so I relearnt that. Tons of css stuff, how to add webfonts, and responsive design basics. 


### Useful resources

Mozilla webdocs and Kevin Powell on YouTube, basically.
